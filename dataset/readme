## Instructions to Reconstruct the Dataset

To combine the dataset parts into a single file for analysis, use the following Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load individual parts
df1 = pd.read_csv("part1.csv")
df2 = pd.read_csv("part2.csv")

# Concatenate into a single DataFrame
full_data = pd.concat([df1, df2], ignore_index=True)
